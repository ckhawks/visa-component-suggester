# VISA Component Suggester
This is a take-home assignment for an interview process for VISA's design engineering team. It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). This project was made in about 4 hours.

## Features
- Simple, clear, and intuitive UI by reducing noise or requirements to get to the main value.
- Performs API request to get suggestion result
- Copy to clipboard function on generated result
- Canned input suggestions for preview of functionality
- Rendered preview of result

## Approach & Technical
- I wanted to design my user experience to be as concise and to-the-point as possible. I am trying to give the user cognitive space to be imaginative with what they would like to build.
- I decided to buid my project using React/Next.js, as I am most comfortable here.
- I use SCSS modules to bundle styles alongside my components.
- I wrote the API handler into the Next.js project using the App Router.

## Assumptions & Shortcuts
- 


## Future Areas of Improvement
Given the limited time constraints of the project, I was not able to implement every feature or layer of polish that I would have liked to.
- I am not well versed enough in leveraging AI to make it return correct usage of the components.
- I am not the best at accessibility but it is something I want to strengthen myself in a lot. I work best when I have things to reference and twist.

## Running the project locally

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
